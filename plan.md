First, I will build a basic server application with express

Next, I will build out a folder structure for my views and models, and I'll have my index.js which is my controller

Then, I'll outline my index.js or controller of how my project will function, this will knit my view and model

After that I'll create/ build out my models using schema, listing all my properties and its data type

Then create my views for the songs and artists, that enables me to be able to view a single artist/song, a list of artist/song, and be able to edit an artist/song, and create a new song

I will then create a public directory to help control the event listeners

Finally knitting!
